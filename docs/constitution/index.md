# Constitution

The Constitution of Finland is the nation's supreme law, guaranteeing fundamental rights and establishing democratic governance. For Turku, it provides the legal basis for its municipal self-government, ensuring the city's right to administer local affairs and levy taxes. All of Turku's local "laws" must comply with this Constitution and the national laws derived from it.
