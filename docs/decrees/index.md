# Decrees

Decrees are a type of legislation that provide more detailed rules and regulations on specific topics, acting to clarify and implement broader laws. Decrees are typically used to adapt legislation to changing circumstances or to fill in gaps in the law, offering a more agile way to manage specific administrative details.

In Finland, national decrees are issued by the President of the Republic, the Council of State (Government), or individual ministries. However, within our community's structure, the Regional Mayor also holds the authority to create decrees. These decrees focus on implementing the broader "laws" or policies within their specific regional jurisdiction.

Decrees created by the Regional Mayor can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tkufi/Turku-Legislation/tree/main/docs/decrees).
