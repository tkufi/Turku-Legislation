# Decrees

Decrees are issued by the President of the Republic, the Council of Ministers, or ministries to clarify and implement Acts of Parliament. They provide more detailed rules and regulations on specific topics and are subordinate to the primary legislation. Decrees are often used to adapt legislation to changing circumstances or to fill in gaps in the law.
