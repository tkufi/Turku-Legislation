# Regulations

Regulations, in the context of local governance, are laws enacted by local governments, such as city councils, to address matters specific to their locality. They provide detailed rules and procedures, serving to implement and enforce broader principles, ensuring compliance within that specific jurisdiction. These local regulations are legally binding and carry the force of law, but they must always align with higher-level state and national legislation.
