# Regulations

---

Regulations are issued by lower-ranking authorities, such as government agencies or municipalities, within the scope of powers granted by the Constitution or Acts of Parliament. They provide specific rules and procedures for implementing legislation and are binding on individuals and organizations within their jurisdiction. Regulations are often used to address local issues or to provide more detailed guidance on specific matters.
